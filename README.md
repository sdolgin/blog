![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/sdolgin/sdolgin.github.io/workflows/Deploy%20to%20GitHub%20Pages/badge.svg)

Source for my blog. I built this to learn more about GitHub Actions, Jekyll & YAML while also having a functional system I can use to write articles on.

The very simple [Jekyll Quickstart Instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) were used as a starting point. You'll also need the full Ruby & Ruby Gem prerequisites which are referenced in the same article.

Once you've got a local runtime installed, to build and serve locally run:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

(include the `--drafts` switch to compile the draft posts as well)
