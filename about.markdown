My name is Saul Dolgin. I'm a programmer by trade with a strong passion for DevOps practices. I work from home in Miami Beach, Florida for [Cognizant's Microsoft Business Group](https://newsignature.com/) but **the content and opinions in this blog are my own.** Although I've had a long professional career online, blogging is new to me. I plan on writing about technology, the future, leadership concepts, self improvement and possibly food.

## The story so far...
After a childhood filled with computing I attended [Florida Atlantic University](https://business.fau.edu/) in Boca Raton, FL and received my B.B.A in Information Technology and Operations Management. Since then I've developed software, built teams and provided consulting to many organizations. I am proud to have helped code one of the first online reverse auction platforms ([Procuri](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/procuri)), built a massive online rebate processing solution ([Systemax](https://www.systemax.com/)), and leveled up with the IT team at a major work from home BPO ([Arise](https://www.arise.com/)).

## Personal life...
When I'm not at the keyboard, I prefer to be outdoors and staying active. I love spending time with my 2 sons and lovely wife at home, who also happen to get top notch tech support from me. Sometimes we travel and I look forward to doing more of that when it's practical again. Exploring new places and visiting with family across the country brings me joy.
