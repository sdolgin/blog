## Background
Having realized the prospect of being indoors for many months in the summer of 2020 I decided to set some professional goals. At that time I had worked with the big 3 cloud platforms (GCP, AWS & Azure) on and off for a number of years. Having realized that the cloud candence was not slowing down I decided to pursue a few professional certifications. This provided an opportunity to sharpen my skills. It could also solve for idle time sitting at home instead of travelling with family over the summer.

The first target goal was to achieve an associate level cert with Azure. I consider myself a developer first and foremost, so I went after AZ-204. I researched other certs such as the Azure Fundamentals or the Azure Administrator but felt that both were not going to be as much of a challenge. Having already worked quite a bit with Azure IaaS resources I wanted to expand into the applications & compute side of things (serverless resources FTW!). It took me a long time to study because of work commitments but I managed to take and pass AZ-204 in August. It was a challenge but I made a plan and set time aside for Udemy and MS Learn. I also purchased the official practice exam which helped me become familiar with the question format and case studies.

With the AZ-204 experience behind me, the next goal was an obvious one for me.  The DevOps Expert certification, which really caught my eye early in my certifications research, was in my crosshairs.  An idea from Good to Great known as a hedgehog concept had suddenly emerged in my professional career... 

[Quote from Good to Great]

Put another way... when planning your career you want to try and find something 1) you're really good at 2) you love to do and 3) that people will pay you to do. My entire career, this "something" for me has been what the business world now refers to as DevOps. There's nothing wrong with working on deliverables for business stakeholders and all, but my passion has always been about putting together people & processes to deliver value. Up until recent years it just hasn't been something most business leaders understood or invested in. Now it's a vital consideration... each company must decide how they will use technology and software to respond to market feedback and they have to do it faster than the competition. That means a profession in DevOps is now snugly in the middle of all 3 criteria for my career. What better motivation to go cert up and pass the AZ-400...

- Prep: the value of hands-on experience, quality of MS Learn, large blocks of time, official practice exam

- Exam Day: remote proctor experience, being nervous about the candidate rules, feeling relieved having done the practice exams, marking the ones I was convinced were completely wrong and did the math.

- Outcome: Took the test in xx minutes, scored 800+, encouraged to do more very soon, continual learning philosophy

- Call to Action: Use this merit as a jumping off point to fully invest in MSFT's DevOps thought leadership. Provide this expertise via consulting to spread seeds of DevOps.
